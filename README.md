In this study, I aim to replicate the results of Basihos (2023)*, who documents a negative relationship between market power and democracy. In particular, her analysis shows that a one-unit increase in aggregate markups is associated with a 0.06-point decrease in a country’s democracy score. This replication relies on a baseline panel model covering 73 countries over a 32-year period. I regress the V-Dem electoral democracy index, used as a proxy for overall democratic quality, on aggregate markups of publicly listed firms, which serve as a measure of market power. Building on the existing literature, I compute market power using firm-level data from the Compustat IQ database.
I employ a long-run dynamic specification estimated via fixed-effects OLS with lagged regressors. The dependent variable, Demc (t+5), represents the country-specific electoral democracy score measured five years ahead. Markup (ct,S)denotes market power at time t, where the superscript  S indicates that firm-level markups are sales-weighted. ​
Five-year lags are used to capture long-run variation, as changes in firms’ market power within a country are unlikely to translate immediately into changes in democratic quality. This modeling choice is consistent with the literature, which suggests that institutional and political outcomes respond to economic forces over medium- to long-run horizons (Acemoglu et al., 2008; Barro, 1999).
